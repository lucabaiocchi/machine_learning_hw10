Code for Homework 10 for Deep Learning Graduate Course (CSC2516) at the University of Toronto.

Final Estimated Mark: 93 or higher (*Not Confirmed Yet)

Thank you for checking out my code!
This is a snippet of how I write code related to Machine Learning/AI. All or almost all code (except some provided functions declarations to fill in) is written by me without external help. 
I believe it to be the most relevant for the job position, and it should display clearly how I reason and write code.

My most significant contributions in the last 3 years have been my full time job at Awakening Software as
a full stack developer. While I cannot share any of my code as I am not allowed, I would be more than happy
to show some of the stuff I have worked on that I do have the authorization to show!
A lot of the software I contributed to is in use today.
